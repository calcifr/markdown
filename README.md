### What’s Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Markdown is different than using using a WYSIWYG editor like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. 

### Why is it useful
There are a couple different reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.

- People use Markdown to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.

- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.

- Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.

- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support.

- Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.
